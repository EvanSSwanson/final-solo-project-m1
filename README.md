## Context:

This project was completed between my fifth and sixth weeks of Turing. It was our final project for the first Mod of the course; this was a solo-project. The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo-v2.html).

## Learning Goals:
- Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
- Write DRY JavaScript and employ constructor classes to create an effective data model
- Route all logic and functionality back to the data model, displaying it on the DOM

### Technology Used:
- Atom
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Chrome Dev Tools
- GitHub

### Wins:
- This was the first project where I felt myself come into my own. After the huge strides I had made with my last group project, [colorandom](https://github.com/Courtney-Lippman/colorandom), I had the tools I needed to go about this project independently.
- With the combo of self-confidence and independence, this project allowed me to truly code 'my way'. This helped me form a sense of developer self-identity.

### Challenges:
- I struggled to discern what good Data Model - DOM separation looked like... Thankfully, with some thoughtful explanations from my fellow cohort, I was able to put much more functionality into my constructor classes.

### Added Features:
- Besides the basic project spec, I added a log-in page to make the user experience dynamic. Furthermore, I experimented with audio implementation.
